# Readme for PretendHomes Site Demo
This is the source code for the mock real estate site project linked to my portfolio. Some files have been ommitted for security purposes (database connection). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of PHP to pull data from an SQL server based upon user input. It is still a work in progress.
